## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Accepting the challenge was a challenge on itself for me as a victim of the Tutorial Hell. Firstly, I read the README.md file thoroughly on what to do and how to do it, and in the end I did complete it.
What I learn is mostly to be brave and confidence on myself.

It is the first time I use custom properties in CSS :

```css
:root {
  --orange: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
  --cyan: hsl(184, 100%, 22%);
  --dark-cyan: hsl(179, 100%, 13%);
  --trans-white: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
  --light-gray: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
}
```

It is laughable because knowing is easy to do, for as long as I learned Web Development, I always avoided to use it.

I also try to use the <article>, and <section> tag to wrap the "text" part (I don't know is it the right thing to do, please do tell) to minimize the use of <div> as I always did.

### Continued development

Still looking for the most simple way to apply repeated CSS (in my case is for the button).

### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This helped me understand what is custom properties on CSS and how to use it.
